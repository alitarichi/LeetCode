168. Excel Sheet Column Title

Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...

 

Example 1:

Input: columnNumber = 1
Output: "A"

Example 2:

Input: columnNumber = 28
Output: "AB"

Example 3:

Input: columnNumber = 701
Output: "ZY"

 

Constraints:

    1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1

The goal of this problem is to convert base10 system to base26 system.
Excel sheet base26 system is represented by the 26 capital letters. Note this system has no concept of 0. 

#solution

/**
 * @param {number} columnNumber
 * @return {string}
 */
var convertToTitle = function(columnNumber) {
  let result = ""
  while (columnNumber > 0){
    columnNumber--
    let remainder = columnNumber % 26;
    result = String.fromCharCode(65 + remainder) + result
    columnNumber = Math.floor(columnNumber / 26)
  }
  return result
};
