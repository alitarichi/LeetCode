598. Range Addition II

You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
Output: 9

 

Constraints:

    1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104
    0 <= ops.length <= 104
    ops[i].length == 2
    1 <= ai <= m
    1 <= bi <= n

**explaination**

I am providing a link of my own solution at the end, but do not jump to it directly without understanding it and trying it on your own. The problem is extremely easy and based on array traversal if you know what is going on with each operation. The question asks you to return the number of maximum elements in the matrix after all the operations.
First of all, consider the base case. If no element is present in ops array, directly return m x n since all elements are maximum (equal to zero).
Now let's say we have n number of operations in the ops array. In each operation, we are given 2 integers a & b and we have to select a sub-matrix of dimension a x b and increment each element in it by 1. If we have 3 operations [2,2], [3,3] & [2,3], and [3,4], the elements in the submatrix [2,2] get incremented in all the 4 operations. So the elements in that sub-matrix will be maximum which is equal to 2 x 2=4 elements.
Did you understand the pattern of increment? No matter how many elements we increase, the sub-matrix with the smallest dimensions will always have the max elements.
So the problem just reduces to finding out the sub-matrix with the smallest dimensions. For that, we require the minimum element from both the first and second fields of the ops array. Let's take an example:
If we have an ops array like this - [[1,3],[4,2],[2,3],[3,3],[2,2]] , the minimum element from the 1st field is 1 (min(1,4,2,3,2)) and from the 2nd field is also 2 (min(3,2,3,3,2)). So the answer is 1 x 2=2. That's it!!

**solution**

/**
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} ops
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxCount = function(m, n, ops) {
    if (ops.length === 0) {
        return m * n
    }

    let minRow = Math.min(...ops.map(op => op[0]))
    let minCol = Math.min(...ops.map(op => op[1]))
    return minRow * minCol
};
