205. Isomorphic Strings
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

    Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
    Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    t.length == s.length
    s and t consist of any valid ascii character

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
        let charS = s[i]
        let charT = t[i]

        if((mapST.has(charS) && mapST.get(charS) !== charT) || 
        (mapTS.has(charT) && mapTS.get(charT) !== charS)) {
            return false
        }
        mapST.set(charS, charT)
        mapTS.set(charT, charS)
    }
    return true
};
