1025. Divisor Game
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

    Choosing any x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0.
    Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 1000

# Solution
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var divisorGame = function(n) {
    if (n === 1) {
        return false;
    } else if (n === 2) {
        return true;
    }else if (n % 2 === 0) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
};


    // If N == 1, you always lose.
    // If N == 2, you can pick x = 1 which leaves a remainder of 1 for the other person that will make them lose. Hence, you win.
    // if N is even, we can always make the other player get a 1 ultimately which means, we can always win if N is even. Conversely, if N is odd, we can never make the other player get a 1, which means we always lose.
