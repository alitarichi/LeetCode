859. Buddy Strings
Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

    For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

Example 2:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.

Example 3:

Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104
    s and goal consist of lowercase letters.

# Solution
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} goal
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var buddyStrings = function(s, goal) {
    if (s.length !== goal.length) return false;

    if (s === goal) {
        return new Set(s).size < s.length;
    }

    let diffs = []
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] != goal[i]) {
            diffs.push([s[i], goal[i]])
        }
    }
    return diffs.length === 2 && diffs[0][0] === diffs[1][1] && diffs[0][1] === diffs[1][0];
};
