997. Find the Town Judge
Solved

Topics
Companies

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

    The town judge trusts nobody.
    Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
    There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 1000
    0 <= trust.length <= 104
    trust[i].length == 2
    All the pairs of trust are unique.
    ai != bi
    1 <= ai, bi <= n

# Solution
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} trust
 * @return {number}
 */
var findJudge = function(n, trust) {
    let trustedBy = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    let trustsSomeone = new Array(n + 1).fill(false)

    for (let [a, b] of trust) {
        trustsSomeone[a] = true; //a trust someone
        trustedBy[b]++;
    }

    //check for town judge
    for (let i =  1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!trustsSomeone[i] && trustedBy[i] === n -1) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1; //No judge found
};
